Project Documentation 
Features Explanation :

The portfolio is designed to be a "living resume." The "About" section introduces me, the "Projects" section displays my work in a clean grid, and the "Contact" section allows users to reach out directly to  debasis8339@gmail.com

Challenges Faced : 

One of the main challenges was ensuring the ' Glassmorphism ' background effects didn't interfere with text readability on mobile devices. I solved this by using CSS media queries to adjust padding and font sizes for smaller viewports.
